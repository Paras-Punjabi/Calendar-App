# CALENDAR
1. In this we can migrate month to month in a particular year using arrow keys.
2. We can also migrate to a particular month of a particular year by clicking on animated title.
3. We can also live GMT time in the calendar itself.
4. This project also includes Calendar.mjs library which has been written from scratch and can also be used for Node.js projects. I had used this library for implementing the logic of this project. 
5. For styling, I had used Bootstrap-5 and some custom CSS.
6. I had used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Library for Icons and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for some attractive fonts.
7. We can also create events for any date and they are stored in our Local Storage. We can easily delete these events, see all events and also had a button of clearing all the events.
